  <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifLqQsbXTuc">JAVA BUZZWORD</a></h2>
  <ol>

    <h3>SIMPLE</h3>
    <p>Java programming language is very simple and easy to learn, understand, and code. Most of the syntaxes in java follow basic programming language C and object-oriented programming concepts are similar to C++. In a java programming language,
      many complicated features like pointers, operator overloading, structures, unions, etc. have been removed. One of the most useful features is the garbage collector it makes java more simple.</p>
    <h3>SECURE</h3>
    <p>Java is said to be more secure programming language because it does not have pointers concept, java provides a feature "applet" which can be embedded into a web application. The applet in java does not allow access to other parts of the
      computer, which keeps away from harmful programs like viruses and unauthorized access</p>
    <h3>PORTABLE</h3>
    <p>Portability is one of the core features of java which enables the java programs to run on any computer or operating system. For example, an applet developed using java runs on a wide variety of CPUs, operating systems, and browsers connected
      to the Internet.</p>
    <h3>OBJECT-ORIENTED</h3>
    <p>Java is said to be a pure object-oriented programming language. In java, everything is an object. It supports all the features of the object-oriented programming paradigm. The primitive data types java also implemented as objects using wrapper
      classes, but still, it allows primitive data types to archive high-performance.</p>
    <h3>ROBUST</h3>
    <p>Java is more robust because the java code can be executed on a variety of environments, java has a strong memory management mechanism (garbage collector), java is a strictly typed language, it has a strong set of exception handling mechanism,
      and many more.</p>
    <h3>ARCHITECTURE-NEUTRAL (or) PLATFORM INDEPENDENT</h3>
    <p>Java has invented to archive "write once; run anywhere, any time, forever". The java provides JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to to archive architectural-neutral or platform-independent. The JVM allows the java program created using one operating
      system can be executed on any other operating system.</p>
    <h3>MULTITHREAD</h3>
    <p>Java supports multi-threading programming, which allows us to write programs that do multiple operations simultaneously</p>
    <h3>INTREPRETED</h3>
    <p>Java enables the creation of cross-platform programs by compiling into an intermediate representation called Java bytecode. The byte code is interpreted to any machine code so that it runs on the native machine.</p>
    <h3>HIGH-PERFORMANCE</h3>
    <p>Java provides high performance with the help of features like JVM, interpretation, and its simplicity.</p>
    <h3>DISTRIBUTED</h3>
    <p>Java programming language supports TCP/IP protocols which enable the java to support the distributed environment of the Internet. Java also supports Remote Method Invocation (RMI), this feature enables a program to invoke methods across a
      network.</p>
    <h3>DYNAMIC</h3>
    <p>Java is said to be dynamic because the java byte code may be dynamically updated on a running system and it has a dynamic memory allocation and deallocation (objects and garbage collector).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>An applet is a small program that is intended not to be run on its own, but
      rather to be embedded inside another application.</li>
    <li>The Applet class must be the super class of any applet that is to be
      embedded in a Web page or viewed by the Java Applet Viewer. The Applet
      class provides a standard interface between applets and their environment.</li>

  <h2><em>Applet Architecture</em></h2>
  <p>
    An applet is a window-based program, its architecture different from the
    console-based programs. There are two key concepts to understand the
    architecture they are
  </p>
  <h3>1. Applets are Event driven</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      An applet waits until an event occurs.
    </li>
    <li>
      The AWT notifies the applet about an event by calling event handler
      that has been provided by the applet.The applet takes appropriate
      action and then quickly return control to AWT
    </li>
    <li>
      All Swing components descend from the AWT Container class
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2. User initiates interaction with an Applet (and not the other way
    around)</h3>
